Welcome to my personal website! 

My name is Thi Hai Yen Pham (aka, Yen Pham). I am an Applied Physics doctoral candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of South Florida. I see myself as a researcher, an educator and a life-long learner. My passion for science is only rivalled by my passion for teaching students and empowering future scientists and engineers.

I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics Education from the Hanoi National University of Education in Vietnam. After earning my degree, I decided to continue my education at the doctoral level to pursue my dream of becoming a scientist. At USF, my research focuses on exploring novel, atomically thin dilute magnetic semiconductors and heterostructures for spintronics and quantum applications under the supervision of professor Manh-Huong Phan. My results have been published in premier journals for Physics, such as Advanced Materials and Advanced Science. I also had opportunities to present my work at many conferences. As a graduate student, I honed not only my research skills but also my teaching skills. As a well-experienced teaching assistant, I have instructed and assisted professors in a wide range of Physics courses, from introductory to advanced levels. The immense experience of working with hundreds of students from different backgrounds has inspired my passion for education and nurtured my skill to become a better educator.
